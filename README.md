Comedy Movie Gifs

Week 6 Assignment: Giftastic

Created during week 6 of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to link up to the Giphy API and get gifs to appear on the screen once a user enters data into the search box and hits the submit button.

My family members were watching the Oscars when I started on this assignment so I chose movies as my theme and in particular, comedies.
